### Tech Stacks

We use Next JS as our front-end framework, there are several reasons why we use Next JS. Objectively, Next JS has a better developer experience compared to others that are available on the market. Subjectively, because it's React, we all love React and so do you.
Besides React, we use Tailwind CSS for our styling tool. We donâ€™t use a UI kit library here, since we design every UIs from scratch. Using a UI kit library in this kind of situation would only bring us to tears.
For any interactive components, we use Radix UI as our headless components.

### Requirements

Since the project is still not Dockerized yet, so you have to install all the following requirements into your machine:

- Node JS v16

Since we use Next JS as our framework, the development workflow is simple:

1. Fork this repository
2. Run the `cd` command into the project directory like `cd code-design`

4. To start the development server, run the `yarn dev` command
